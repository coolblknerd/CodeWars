// Your objective is to complete a recursive function reverse() that receives str as String and returns the same string in reverse order

// Rules:

// reverse function should be executed only N times. N = length of the input string
// helper functions are not allowed
// changing the signature of the function is not allowed


-------------------
Original Solution
-------------------

function reverse(str) {
 if (str.length < 2) return str;
 return reverse(str.substr(1)) + str.charAt(0);
}

// Had to get some help from the internet since I kept creating a recursive function which called
from a array I created outside of the function.  This caused a lot of issues later on.  The answer
I found was on a reddit forum and I had to play with each part of it until I got a solid understanding of what was going on underneath the hood.
